# Rediscovering CVE-2022-0324

Im currently reading a book called
from day zero to zero day and one of the exercises is to rediscover a vulnerability in a DHCPv6 relay
server in Software for Open Networking in the Cloud (SONiC). SONiC is
an open source Linux operating system (OS) that runs on various network
switches.

i'll give my own unique perspective and analysis of the vulnerability.
